# Sewer Academy: A Rat Dating Simulator

Author: Alyssa Lee and Madeline Anthony

Design: You get to romance up to two rats. also theyre ~twins~ 

Text Drawing: The text is shaped using harfbuzz and rendered with freetype. Individual textures for each glyph are loaded the first time that glyph appears, then they are stored in a map. Most text rendering code followed [this tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/Text-Rendering) (thanks to hjamal for sharing!). Dialogue was created in a simple text file and stored/loaded using chunks.
