* It's your first day here at Sewer Academy. Mildew drips from the ceiling and the smell of feces wafts through the halls. This place is so much nicer than your old school, Wastewater High. As you skitter up the pipes to the front entrance, you contemplate how to approach your first day...

    - Put a little swagger in your step.

10:1
* You stop in front of the classroom and step apart. But he doesn't leave. Instead, he faces you, rubbing the back of his neck nervously. Part of his shirt lifts as he does and you can see just a hint of the washboard abs and vicious V underneath.

        >16

* Leaning with his arms crossed is a rugged white rat with black eyeliner and and shoulder-length head fur tied half-up in a bun. He's wearing a black leather jacket, fingerless gloves, and a bass guitar slung across his back.

* You stand in front of him, arms crossed. Unmoving. He raises an eyebrow and gives you a once-over, but you don't budge. He tilts his head and kicks off the wall of lockers, making room for you. You step forward and start turning your combination.

* “Almost forgot something.” He says behind you.
    - continue
        >21
21:1
* As you turn around to look at him, you're suddenly slammed against the lockers. His arm beside your head, pinning you. His face is close, centimeters away, his warm breath on your cheek. A shiver runs down your spine.

* “Meet me under the bleachers during 2nd period.”
    - continue

* You blush and finish turning the lock, idly stowing your books. Maybe you can get used to Sewer Academy after all.
    - Start over?
        >0
